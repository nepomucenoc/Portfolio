# :sparkles: Ana Carolina Nepomuceno Costa
<sub>Master's student in Modeling and Quantitative Methods at the Federal University of Ceara - UFC</sub>

I have experience in teaching mathematics in schools, so I have communication skills.

My academic formation includes a Master's in progress in Modeling and Quantitative Methods at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), a postgraduate in mathematics teaching in high school at the State University of Ceara (UECE), and a graduate in mathematics at Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Ceará State (IFCE). I am a certificate in Artificial Intelligence from Huawei and Microsoft Azure. I have experience with Data Science and Data Analytics. I am searching for remote jobs in Data Science and Machine Learning using python language.

I know about Statistics, Python, Machine Learning, BI, and MLOps for Data Science.

I am searching for new remote jobs with Data Science and Machine Learning using Python language.
